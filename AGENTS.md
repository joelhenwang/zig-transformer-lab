# Agent Brief — zig-transformer-lab

## One-sentence mission

Build a pedagogical Zig 0.16.0 library that trains a tiny 1-block 1-head word-level
transformer on CPU, then on CUDA, with extensive documentation and heavily commented
code that teaches how PyTorch-like systems work internally.

## Hard rules

- Do not violate Locked Decisions D1 through D14 or policies P1 through P4.
  Ask the user before changing any decision. See `docs/00_overview.md` for the full table.
- No third-party Zig dependencies.
- Zig version pinned at 0.16.0 (exact).
- f32 only. No mixed precision.
- GPU kernels are CUDA C only. No pure-Zig GPU kernels.
- Kernels are compiled offline with nvcc to .ptx and loaded via cuModuleLoadData.
- Never copy code from LGPL sources. Architectural ideas only, attributed in file headers.

## Workflow

- Implement stages 1 through 9 in order. Do not interleave stages.
- Commit after each stage with `stage(N): <summary>`; paste acceptance outputs
  into the commit body.
- Docs chapter for a stage ships in the same commit as the stage's code.

## Style

- File header block: purpose, shape contract, math formulas, ownership, errors,
  TODOs, credits.
- Explicit allocators. No hidden globals. No `@panic` outside tests.
- `zig fmt` clean. Tests co-located via `test "..."` blocks.
- Every public function has a worked shape example in its doc comment.
- Pedagogical comments: explain *why*, not just *what*. ~30-40% of non-blank
  lines should be comments.

## Zig 0.16.0 patterns

Use modern 0.16 API exclusively:
- `pub fn main(init: std.process.Init) !void`
- `b.createModule(...)`, `root_module.addImport(...)`
- `var list: ArrayList(T) = .empty; list.append(gpa, v)`
- `@ptrFromInt`, `@intFromPtr`, `@intFromEnum` (not the old cast builtins)
- `callconv(.c)` not `callconv(.C)`
- Explicit re-exports, never `usingnamespace`

## CUDA sacred spots

- Row-major to column-major wrapping in `src/backend/cuda/gemm.zig`. Dedicated tests.
- Bounds checks in every kernel.
- Offline .ptx only (no NVRTC).
- Bindings module opens libraries with dlopen at runtime.
- Link `libc` + `dl`, never `libcuda` directly.

## When stuck

- Ask the user with a crisp options-style question (max 4 options).
- Never guess at hardware, environment, or decisions.

## Full plan

See `plan.md` at the repository root and `docs/00_overview.md`.
